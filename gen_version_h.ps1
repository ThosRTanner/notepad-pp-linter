# OK, let's work out how we are going to set up the version header.

# x.y.z
# x.y.z+<build>
# x.y.z-<prerelease>
# x.y.z-<prerelease>+<build>

# We basically ignore the prerelease and build parts of the tag, and go back to
# the previous x.y.z tag for the major, minor and patch versions.
#
# We then use that and the number of commits since that tag for the 4th fields
# in the dll version header.

# This is the official semver regex, but I've broken it down to make it
# easier to read and adjusted the captures for powershell.
