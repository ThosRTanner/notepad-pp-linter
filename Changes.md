# Change log

## 1.0.1

Added the ability to display error details. If you double click an entry in the system errors tab, either:

1. If the error was in parsing linter++.xml, it will be opened and the cursor set to the position of the error. Fixes #26.
1. otherwise, a new notepad buffer will be created containing the command that was run and any output or error output. Fixes #50

This probably fixes a few issues where the extension could hang or decide it had received no output, as I completely rewrote the code that received output from the linter.

Fixed an issue where the first file was taking a long time to process (see #13). It can sometimes still take a long time, but it's less long now.

Adds support for creating your own environment variables (with the `<variables>` XML tag) and also added two new environment variables:

- LINTER_PLUGIN_DIR - Directory where linter++.dll is installed
- LINTER_CONFIG_DIR - Directory where your linter++.xml is installed.

I've added some powershell scripts into the plugin directory which can be used for linting markdown files and powershell scripts.

I've also changed the parsing slightly to ensure that the content of `<args>` tags is parsed as a token (whitespace is compressed and trimmed). I originally intended it to be like that, bit microsft XML treats xs:token as the same as a string.

## 1.0.0
